# Band Allocator Using Graph Coloring 

## Despcription
To enhance public safety, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India plans to allocate new wireless radio frequencies for emergency communication in each Indian state. While ideally, each state would have a unique frequency to prevent interference, two challenges arise: limited bandwidth with only four frequencies available and legacy communication equipment in some states that can operate on only one specific frequency, which may overlap with others. Fortunately, since radio waves have limited range, the solution only requires ensuring that neighboring states do not share the same frequency. As a resourceful consultant, your task is to write a Python program to assign frequencies A, B, C, and D to the states while adhering to these constraints.
